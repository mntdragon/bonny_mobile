5	1. Tell about git
6	  - Git is a version control system.
7	  - Used for tracking changes in code files in sofrware development.
8	    But could be used for any files as well.
9	  - Created by Linus Torvalds
10	  - If you use hosted git (in a cloud) it is a backup tool also.
11	
12	2. Tell about GitHub
13	  - GitHub is a web based Git repository hosting service
14	  - Free or paid plans available
15	  - I am using free version for school projects ==> Everything is public.
16	  * https://github.com => Show and describe the main page.
17	
18	3. Create a git repository.
19	  - Repository stores your project files and history of changes to those files.
20	  - You can have one or multiple repositories for your project. For example:
21	    - 1 repository for iOS client project
22	    - 1 repository for Android client project
23	    - 1 repository for backend imeplementation (servers, databases, in a cloud)
24	  - You create your repositories to GitHub easily. (Main page => New
25	    repository).
26	  * Create repository for backend. (Describe what backend means).
27	    * Give a name reporter
28	    * Write a description
29	    * Tick README button. Tell audience about the README.md file.
30	  - To use git you must have git software installed to your
31	    development machine.
32	      - There are multiple git clients, some have graphical user interface
33	        but I'm using command line client.
34	        https://git-scm.com/downloads
35	
36	4. Clone the repository
37	  - Clone the repository to your development machine. Currently there
38	    is only one file. The readme file.
39	  > git clone git@github.com-oamk-veikko:oamk-veikko/reporter-demo.git
40	  - Describe what we have just done.
41	  - Create a simple text file and push it to remote repository
42	  > cd reporter
43	  > atom test.txt
44	  - Write something to the file and save it.
45	  > ls
46	  > git status
47	  > git add --all
48	  > git status
49	  > git commit -m"Demo change will do this and that."
50	  > git push origin master
51	  - Show now the repository in the web browser. New file is there.
52	  - Show and describe the commit history. Open Pint Please repo!
53	
54	5. Create node.js / Heroku skeleton to repo
55	  * Install node.js (Download packages from https://nodejs.org/en/)
56	  - Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's JavaScript engine.
57	  - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
58	  - Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.
59	  - We have installed npm client during the node.js installation
60	  * Open terminal, goto repo you created in the previous step
